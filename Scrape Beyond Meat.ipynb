My dad is keto, which means he supposed to only eat up to 20 carbs a day and he loves eating the beyond meat from this brand. They are also high in protein and include no trans fat. They are worth all 540 calories! They cook in less time than actually burgers and only spittle a little. The only thing is that it takes a little practice to learn how to cook them to your taste. I like mine a little more rare, while my dad likes his a little more cooked. It can smoke up the house or kitchen you are in. The flavor is amazing and tastes like an actual burger. I like to put a slice of Chao vegan cheese and cover on low heat until the cheese melts, about 1-3 minutes after finishing cooking. They will stain any pans you use and make dishes a little harder, but these are so healthy and tasty that I am just in love with eating them. The thickness is good for burger-lovers, I personally like the patties more just think the burgers are harder to eat. I still buy both though, for a delicious variety.

My dad is keto, which means he supposed to only eat up to 20 carbs a day and he loves eating the beyond meat from this brand. They are also high in protein and include no trans fat. They are worth all 540 calories! They cook in less time than actually burgers and only spittle a little. The only thing is that it takes a little practice to learn how to cook them to your taste. I like mine a little more rare, while my dad likes his a little more cooked. It can smoke up the house or kitchen you are in. The flavor is amazing and tastes like an actual burger. I like to put a slice of Chao vegan cheese and cover on low heat until the cheese melts, about 1-3 minutes after finishing cooking. They will stain any pans you use and make dishes a little harder, but these are so healthy and tasty that I am just in love with eating them. The thickness is good for burger-lovers, I personally like the patties more just think the burgers are harder to eat. I still buy both though, for a delicious variety.

If you are thinking of trying this don't worry about the bad reviews.. just try it for yourself.(my review) Oh my god.. when i first smelled it it was very unpleasant. It smelled like I just opened a can of cat/spam food. I couldn't get over that smell.. it stayed with me as I cooked... but I am a brave guy. I eat anything and just don't get grossed out.First day:Cook a burger patty. Everytime I took a bite an extremely unpleasant odor enters first and let me tell you... I wish I can explain it. It's just really off putting. Again, I am a brave guy.. don't care. I continue eating 1 very unpleasant bite after another.Ok. So I am done with the burger... now I have this very unpleasant aftertaste in my mouth the entire night. It was awful... really, really awful (my constant burping did not help.)Day 2: I am going to do this again differently. Open the bag (that awful weird smell hits me first) Oh my god. it is so awful because it is nothing like I have experienced before... ok. So this time I have indian spices... My goal is to kill the aftertaste. I added enough curry to kill an indian bengal tiger.... sadly, that aftertaste is right there.No day 3. I threw it in the garbage. I am not that brave.In conclusion. I think this effects a small % (from the reviews it seems like around 5%) of people that eat it experience the cat/dog food sensation. The rest of the population don't seem affected.it's a shame because the texture was in my opinion perfect and I am leaving a 5 star review because I wish them all the best.Don't listen to anyone.. try it for yourself.\\n\\n\", 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars', 'reviewer_name': 'Rubi-dub-dub'}\n",

It is not nearly as strong as an open can of cat food, and it also mostly dissipates during cooking. Unfortunately, if you have a very acute sense of smell, it is always there in the background and ultimately makes the product unpalatable to me. I won't rule out the possibility that This may be one of those foods that triggers different reactions in people based upon genetics like cilantro.I ate it in the form of a burger with a very strongly flavored topping made from ketchup, mayonnaise, mustard, chopped cherry peppers, and a beet-cabbage sauerkraut. That almost completely masked the strange odor, which resulted in a pretty enjoyable burger at the time. That being said, I shouldn't have to drown my food and strong flavors to mask some thing that is offensive about it.I also crumbled up some and sautéed it like ground beef to use as a taco filling. Even though I mixed it with a fairly strongly flavored spicy chipotle salsa, the smell was still readily apparent. My stomach also feels a little bit queasy after eating it, and now that I think about it, my stomach was a bit off from the burger, as well. This is not normal for me.I might think that I have gotten a bad package, but I have read about the strange cat foot odor in several other places before coming here to write this review. It is possible what we were all referring to is a batch that was spoiled. Oh well. I was hopeful but will probably be reluctant to try this particular variety again.I will say that I very much enjoyed their Italian sausage but will not continue to buy that, either. That is because I suspect that underneath all of these strongly flavored spices I would find the same cat food odor.\\n\\n\", 'rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'reviewer_name': 'ToddinSD'}\n",

      "{'title': '\\nJust No\\n', 'body': '\\n\\n  I can\\'t specify exactly what it is about this product that is the most distasteful and this is just my honest review. I have been a lacto-ovo-vegetarian for almost 15 years. As such, in addition to almost every vegetable and legume, including peas and mung beans, I enjoy cheese and dairy. Years ago, prior to becoming a vegetarian, I had a recipe for blue cheese burgers on toasted slices of a french baguette that at that time I really enjoyed.  I still enjoy cheese and french baguettes so after reading the reviews of this product I was inspired to recreate the \"vegetarian\" version. Regrettably, this product was a huge disappointment.  There is an odor as others have mentioned. To me it smells chemical and related to the starches, though I\\'m not an expert. All I can say is there is an unpleasant odor when raw that does not at all dissipate when the product is cooked. The cooked texture is comparable to beef if you are looking for texture. The raw and cooked color is comparable to beef if you are looking for color. The flavor is something else. I personally was not looking for a beef flavor, but for a neutral plant based flavor. This product is nowhere near neutral enough. Depending on the intended recipe, this may be acceptable to you, but it is definitely not a neutral plant based substitute for beef. So between the odor and flavor, I would definitely not recommend the product.\\n\\n', 'rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars', 'reviewer_name': 'Ca8Vs6'}\n",

      "{'title': \"\\nTastes Amazing! Not an everyday meat replacement... here's why...\\n\", 'body': \"\\n\\n  I first tried this via Carls', Jr. where the Beyond burgers tasted as close to meat (in terms of taste, texture, mouth feel, and even appearance) as I've ever had considering it's not beef. Finally decided to give up meat for awhile (probably six months or so to help lose weight and be more healthy) and thought this would make a great every day protein subsititute for chicken, turkey, and beef. Here's the thing... This is truly a phenomenol product and YES, YES, YES you should buy and try it and most people will absolutely love this (ignore the morons who complain it isn't a burger... oh, duh... it's not real meat... or the vegan lunatics who whine and complain that it bleeds from the beet juice while cooking and looks too real -wtf!). However, after eating 5.25 ounces of Beyonde beef every day for a week and a half (just takes 10 seconds to form a burger right out of the package and throw it into a dry frying pan on medium heat... couldn't be any easier), I felt so slugish and my arteries were clogging (not kidding, having chest pain). Now, that's not at all the Beyond burger's fault but just my health. Still, the point is that this thing has an unnecessary amount of fat (some of it reasonably health fat) but there's just no excuse for the sheer copious amount of fat overkill in this thing -presumably to trick your mind into thinking your frying up or cooking up the real deal. It doesn't add to the taste, and so much grease is left in the frying pan -which started out dry -by the end of cooking that I had to consider checking the label again. I did the math to figure out just how much fat and what kinds of fat I was really eating. I thought it was all super healthy coconut oil, but it isn't. So, this enormously fat ladden fat bomb from hell tastes utterly amazing. I will still eat it once in a while, but I have given it up as a meat replacement on the regular. This is absolutely not good for people with heart disease or who otherwise need to be extra careful about clogging their arteries. So, yes... a great sub for a burger but carnivores can also just eat the real thing, because 90/10 meat has an amount of fat in the same ballpark as this and with far, far, far less sodium (I never salt burgers I make from scratch but opt for garlic/onion powder and pepper instead and they taste awesome). Finally, there is a lot of critique that this is overly processed, blah, blah. OK fine, but the take away is what is your ingredient list? Beyond burger is non-gmo and has a lot of nutrition value... if they would cut the fat by a third, it'd be a better and healthier product for all to enjoy more frequently.\\n\\n\", 'rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'reviewer_name': 'B.
